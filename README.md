# CSC312 ‚Äì Assignment 1: Linear Regression

## üìù Overview
This project, *Assignment 1* for the **CSC312 ‚Äì Machine Learning** course, focuses on the fundamental implementation and application of **Linear Regression**.

The assignment is contained within an interactive Jupyter Notebook (`CSC312_Assignment_1_Linear_Regression_ex-2.ipynb`) and is divided into two main parts:

1.  **Part 1: Univariate (Simple) Linear Regression**
    * Develop a predictive model for an ice-cream chain's daily profit (in 1000s of Rand) based on the daily temperature above 20¬∞C.

2.  **Part 2: Multivariate Linear Regression**
    * Explore and implement linear regression with multiple features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook successfully, you will need the following:

* **Python 3 Kernel**: The notebook must be executed with a Python 3 kernel.
* **NumPy**: The `numpy` library is required for data handling and calculations.

### Project Files

The following files are required in the same directory as the main notebook (`CSC312_Assignment_1_Linear_Regression_ex-2.ipynb`) to ensure all code cells run correctly:

* `CSC312_Assignment_1_Linear_Regression_ex-2.ipynb`: The main assignment notebook.
* `data1.csv`: Dataset for the Univariate Linear Regression (Part 1).
* `data2.csv`: Dataset for the Multivariate Linear Regression (Part 2).
* `utils.py`: Utility functions required for testing and setup.

### Running the Notebook

1.  Ensure all the required files (`.ipynb`, `.csv`, and `.py`) are in the same directory.
2.  Open the `CSC312_Assignment_1_Linear_Regression_ex-2.ipynb` notebook using a Python 3 kernel.
3.  Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom, as lower cells often depend on functions and variables defined earlier in the sheet.

The notebook provides interactive feedback cells after many tasks to help verify the correctness of the implementation as you progress.
